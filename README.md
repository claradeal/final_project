# final_project
Create a CRUD app.
1. A page to CREATE a new item in the database
2. A page to list all created items READ from the database
3. A page to show the details of one item READ from the database
4. Fields on the details page that can be UPDATED in the database
5. The ability to DELETE an item from the database
6. Design is entirely up to you. Bare minimum is a bulleted list on one page and a bunch of form fields on a different page.
7. Once you have the basics in place for all of these, THEN start elaborating and polishing.
8. You have ~4 weeks to get this done
9. In the last week you will be expect to submit at least one pull request against the codebase of each of the fellow students to try to help them
10. Look things up. Read documentation. And ask for help, ESPECIALLY on concepts.
11. Use Git and GitHub. Use any tooling and libraries you think will help you get things done faster.
12. The "items" you are keeping track of can be anything. Pick something you are interested in. Maybe related to hobby. Just something that you will sound passionate about when talking to someone in an interview.
